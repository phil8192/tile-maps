# Tile maps

> Mapping a set of random points to a uniform lattice

# Problem

Given a set of N polygons corresponding to countries/regions/municipalities find
a [regular tessellation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularTessellation.html)
of N triangles, squares, or hexagons where each tile corresponds to a country
such that the
[original spatial arrangement is preserved](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/05/11/hex-tile-maps.html)
as much as possible.

More generally, find a mapping from a set of N arbitrary/random points whilst
preserving the original arrangement.

The code in this repository is experimental.
For an excellent/stable R package solution to this problem, see

# Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach

My first approach to this problem makes use of Linear Programming.

## Installing COIN-OR

[Cbc](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) (Coin-or branch and cut) is an
open-source mixed integer programming solver. It is faster than
the [GNU Linear Programming Kit](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) (GLPK).

```
git clone --branch=stable/2.9 https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc Cbc-2.9
cd Cbc-2.9
git clone --branch=stable/0.8 https://github.com/coin-or-tools/BuildTools/
chmod 0700 BuildTools/get.dependencies.sh
BuildTools/get.dependencies.sh fetch
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cbc-parallel
make
sudo make install
```

verify parallel enabled

```
cbc -threads 8 -unitTest -dirMiplib=_MIPLIB3DIR_ -miplib
```


# Simulated Annealing (SA) approach

My second approach to this problem makes use of the popular Simulated Annealing
metaheuristic.
